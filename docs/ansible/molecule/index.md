# Molecule Tutorial


## [Ansible generator](./role_generator.md)
Here i try to give a short description in how to create and test role with my [Ansible role generator](./molecule_getting_started) ([github](https://github.com/mullholland/ansible-generator)) and some [snippets](./molecule_verify_snippets.md) for molecule verify via ansible.

The explanation require a base understanding of Ansible and Molecule.
If someone is interested, maybe we can talk about what a more complete tutorial should look like.
