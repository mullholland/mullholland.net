# HOME

Hello there,

welcome to my simple homelab documentation.  
  
This documentation is as much help for someone with the same problems as myself as it is my own documentation. I experiment with new technologies and stuff.  
The content might differ, depending on my motivation at the time of documentation. If you think there is something important missing you can open an `issue` [here](https://github.com/mullholland/mullholland.net). And if you find an error or want to add something you can open a `pull request`.
